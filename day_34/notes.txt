A trivia app! This does not seem markedly different from the quiz app ... I suppose it's to expand the quiz app haha.
... But I already did most of this during the actual quiz app day, on day 17. Wellp.
I guess the tkinter review/repetition is good!!

-html unescape is pretty cool, good to know at least too.
It's interesting how the teacher of this course wants us to not just text parse in main too ...

I finally get how to wrap text in a tkinter canvas object!!! That's something!!
Differences:
-I used 'scorelabel' and not 'score_label', oops. Still gotta iron out my pep-8 adherence.
-I named my question text 'canvas_text' and had a second self.question_text object with just a pure string in it.
-Also did this with the score text, haha.
-Different amounts of padding.
-I made the true and false img things objects within the class.

But generally it looked better than two weeks ago! #progress

I did not know that you can import a class type and then ensure that you're recieving a specific type of class in a class declaration!!! That's really nice!
You can declare a variable just as a datatype. I knew this but don't really use it much, nice to see it and it really checks out with the class declaration part. Nice

Fair amount of things we needed to update with the quiz brain to get them to all pipe properly into the UI class here!

Lots of good knowledge to have :) I added the total # of questions you've taken yet as well from the quiz brain, but glad to see this actually was a lesson, haha.
