## The Process of a Refresher Course

### Intro

Hi. I know it looks a bit weird doing this sort of thing when I have seven years of professional Python experience, haha. But I wanted to do it for a few reasons:

-I took a yearlong sabbatical where I purposefully did not code. It's very nice to be refreshing all of the stuff I used to know, and add things that I didn't have to deal with before, as I jump back into it!

-The python projects I've done professionally haven't been ones where I am a full stack developer, so there are holes in my knowledge. So ... I think it's very good to have this practice and expand my palate of known things (tm) in a simple way, if that makes sense.

-I can look at the earlier days and know the bad habits that I fall into, so I can work on them going forwards. And I can also know ... where my path diverges from the 'official' solution, which is nice to see.

### Caveats

I am doing every day of this course, but likely will not upload every day - just when the result feels important.

I also:
-Have a few days of vacation scheduled in the middle of taking this course and am making myself take this one day at a time so I actually retain the information, so will not have output every single day until the course ends.
-may not end up finishing the course on a perfect 1 to 1 scale after day 67, simply because the expert-level challenges, from what I can see and have read, get very deep into the weeds and are not necessary.

But we'll see! The best-laid plans and all that.

### Conclusion

I'll update this readme near the end with more specifics about the code that I'm the most proud of, hopefully. But it's all a process! :)
