The eight TODOS:
-Create the screen
-Create and move a paddle
-Create a second paddle
-Create the ball, make it move
-Detect collision with wall and bounce
-Detect collision with paddle
-Detect when paddle misses
-Keep score

Mine were:

[I skipped the screen part.]
-First: we want to code up the paddles. 'Make a paddle appear on the screen.'
Then, 'Make the paddle move up and down'
Then, 'Make another paddle on the other side'

Then, 'Make a ball move across the screen with some physics'
Then, 'Make the ball detect collision on the edges of the screen'
Then, 'Make the ball detect collision on paddles'

Then, 'Make the score change when the ball passes a paddle, and reset the game to play again, until you get to 7'

Then, 'Make the other paddle move depending on where the ball is'
-We want to code up collision on the paddles
-We want to code up the scoreboard
-We want to code up the ball
-Then, finally, we code up the evil paddle.

The main pong game was coded much clearer generally -
I still think too much in if statements and should pause and figure out better ways to do what I'm looking at -
but I did include a robot player which is something :) and my implementation does work!
Pretty good, in the end.
