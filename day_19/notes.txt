-Event listeners!
--Specifically Turtle Event listeners!
This basically is a thing where the program 'listens' for keyboard input and then does something based on that input.

So with turtle and python, here's a short example program:

from turtle import Turtle, Screen
turt = Turtle() # Mario crushes turts
screen = Screen()
def move_forwards():
    turt.forward(10)
screen.listen() # now we're listening!
screen.onkey(key="space", fun=move_forwards)
screen.exitonclick()

And with this, when we press space, we move forwards. And if we really want we can move all around with simply:

def move_forwards():
    turt.forward(10)

def move_backwards():
    turt.backward(10)   

def turn_left():
    turt.left(10)

def turn_right():
    turt.right(10)

def clear_screen():
    screen.clear_screen()

screen.listen() # now we're listening!
screen.onkey(key="Up", fun=move_forwards)
screen.onkey(key="Down", fun=move_backwards)
screen.onkey(key="Left", fun=turn_left)
screen.onkey(key="Right", fun=turn_right)
screen.onkey(key="c", fun=clear_screen)
screen.exitonclick()


The main thing that this part of the course emphasizes is that you can have different instances of a class doing different things -
Their states can be different and they can act completely differently from each other.
The whole point of a class is to make class objects that all can use aspects of a class but can be totally different.
We use the Turtle class for this in this day of lessons.
This whole concept is why object-oriented programming is so powerful - we orient all our code around using these objects.
So all the code creates objects, then we adjust the objects, and then they do new, novel things, with the interaction of 
the adjusted objects and the way we use them. No need to reinvent the wheel :)
