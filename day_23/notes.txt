There were three 'levels' of hard for this: expert was 'do it by yourself', 
hard was 'do it with the breakdown of what you should make', and medium was 'follow all the instructions'.

I elected to do hard because a lot of what I'm doing here is not just figuring out merely /how/ to write code that works
(I could've written this code at the beginning of the class after reading the turtle documentation).
It's to learn how to do it the "right way" - clearly, with clean code that's easily readable and reusable, and quickly.

After watching the walkthrough I'm pretty happy with it! Did everything /close enough/ to what was expected.
Differences:
-I made the cars precisely once every 6 cycles, instead of using a random integer to do it.
-I made a 'collision' function in the car manager instead of doing it in the main.py.
-I used the trick that we used in the last day (making the refresh rate faster, 
 which increases the speed of everything) instead of making the cars faster themselves.
-I did also have two variables tracking the count per run. Three if you count the internal scoreboard one. Oops.
-The provided font in the starter code is different from the font in the finished program for some reason? Weird.
