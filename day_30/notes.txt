"""Today is error handling day! Finally :D
Various errors:"""
# FileNotFoundError
# with open("a_file.txt") as file:
#     file.read()

# #KeyError
# a_dictionary = {"key":"value"}
# value = a_dictionary["nonexistant_key"]

# IndexError
# fruit_list=["apple","banana","pear"]
# fruit=fruit_list[3]

# TypeError
# text = "abc"
# print(text + 5)

# To fix an error, you wrap it in a try/except block, like:

# # FileNotFoundError
# try:
#     with open("a_file.txt") as file:
#         file.read()
# except: #If this breaks we pass. But this makes the code do nothing
#     print("There was an error :(")

# #We can fix it like this:
# try:
#     with open("a_file.txt") as file:
#         file.read()
# except: #If this breaks, it's because there's nothing there and we should make the file
#     file = open("a_file.txt", "w")
#     file.write("Something")

# #But the error is too broad, we should really catch the specific type of exception
# try:
#     with open("a_file.txt") as file:
#         file.read()
# except FileNotFoundError: #If this breaks, it's because there's nothing there and we should make the file
#     file = open("a_file.txt", "w")
#     file.write("Something")

# #And we can stack exceptions:
# try:
#     file = open("a_file.txt")
#     a_dictionary = {"key": "value"}
#     print(a_dictionary["not_a_key"])
# except FileNotFoundError: #If this breaks, it's because there's nothing there and we should make the file
#     file = open("a_file.txt", "w")
#     file.write("Something")
# except KeyError as error_message: #We can also of course print out the exact error by naming it like this
#     print(f"The key {error_message} does not exist.")
# else: #if you try and it has no exceptions ...
#     content=file.read()
#     print(content)
# finally: #At the end of the loop regardless of any other circumstances ...
#     file.close()

# #And we can raise an exception!

# raise TypeError("This is an error that I made up.")

height = float(input("Height: "))
weight = float(input("Weight: "))

if height > 3:
    raise ValueError("That's not right")

print(bmi)
#That's weird if you're over 3 meters what. Error time. So we catch it above!

# And from here we corrected two old programs, which I have copied into this folder.
