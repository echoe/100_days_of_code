This is the API lesson!!
Won't work too much longer now since the whole project we make here is tracking the ISS ... I guess we can track it in the ground maybe lol.
This is most of what I've done in my career with python, pulling information from APIs and uploading to APIs ... so a nice simple lesson haha.
And we're using requests, haha :)
