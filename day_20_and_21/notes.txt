This is where we get into inheritance! You can define a class that inherits features of another class.
after the name of the class, just provide the class we want to inherit from:

class Fish(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__() < initializes the animal class in the fish class.


So EG:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self):
        self.num_eyes = 2
    def breath(self):
        print("Inhale, exhale.")

class Fish:
    def swim(self):
        [rint("moving in water")]

nemo = Fish()
nemo.swim()

If I want the Fish to inherit all the features of Animal, I just need to do this:

class Fish(animal):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def swim(self):
        [rint("moving in water")]

And now I can:

nemo = Fish()
nemo.swim()
nemo.breathe()
print(nemo.num_eyes)

To modify functions from the existing class, you can get a hold of the super class, and call it in the new class.

class Fish(animal):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def swim(self):
        [rint("moving in water")]
    
    def breathe(self):
        super().breathe()
        print("and we are underwater wow!")

The call to super() in the initializer is recommended but /not required/.
