GUIS with TKinter! Wowee Zowee.

(Bla bla bla, they replaced consoles for the vast majority of computer users.)

Advanced python:
def argument(a, b, c)
def argument(a=1, b=1, c=1) < functions with default values. I thought we'd already done this but maybe we didn't?

You can accept infinite argmnents with *paramname! Like, if you want to add an infinite # of inputs you can:

def function(*args):
    result = 0
    for n in args:
        result += n
    return result

These are positional arguments. You've also got keyword arguments (**kwargs)! these are passed in as a dictionary to the function.
def calculate(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs)

calculate(add=3, multiply=5)

More ways to deal with arguments, like this:

def calculate(n, **kwargs):
    """You can handle these kwargs in so many ways"""
    print(kwargs)
    n += kwargs["add"]
    n *= kwargs["multiply"]
    print(n)

calculate(2, add=3, multiply=5)


With tkinter you can get options "in three ways". You have the keyword args, but you can also:
-treat the option name as a directory index
-use the config method to update attributes
Examples:
example=Button(self, fg="red", bg="blue")
example["fg"]="red"
example.config(fg="red)

They provide a whole python file of examples in Other_Tkinter_Widgets as well.

I would want, I think, the layout of all of the parts of my tkinter project to happen at the bottom so I can organize them easily that way.
